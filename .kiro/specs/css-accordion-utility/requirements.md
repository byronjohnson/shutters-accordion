# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Shutters CSS Accordion Menu Utility is a lightweight, developer-friendly accordion component that prioritizes simplicity and customization. The utility provides a minimal CSS-based accordion implementation with optional JavaScript enhancements, designed for easy integration into any web project. The component follows a modular architecture separating critical functionality from presentation styles, allowing developers to use only what they need.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a web developer, I want a CSS-based accordion menu utility that requires minimal JavaScript, so that I can implement accordion functionality without heavy dependencies or complex setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the accordion THEN the system SHALL use primarily CSS for functionality with minimal vanilla JavaScript if needed
2. WHEN a developer includes the utility THEN the system SHALL provide a working accordion with less than 50 lines of critical CSS
3. IF JavaScript is required THEN the system SHALL use only vanilla JavaScript without external dependencies

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the utility, I want the CSS to be split between critical functionality and presentation styles, so that I can customize the appearance while maintaining core functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the utility is structured THEN the system SHALL provide critical CSS in a separate file from presentation CSS
2. WHEN a developer uses only critical CSS THEN the system SHALL maintain full accordion functionality without presentation styles
3. WHEN presentation CSS is included THEN the system SHALL provide a complete black and white themed accordion design

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer using the utility, I want all critical CSS classes to be prefixed with "shutters-", so that I can avoid naming conflicts with existing styles in my project.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critical CSS classes are defined THEN the system SHALL prefix all class names with "shutters-"
2. WHEN the utility is integrated THEN the system SHALL not conflict with existing CSS class names
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate which classes use the "shutters-" prefix

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the presentation layer to use a black and white color scheme, so that I have a clean, professional default appearance that fits most design systems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN presentation CSS is applied THEN the system SHALL use only black, white, and grayscale colors
2. WHEN hover states are implemented THEN the system SHALL maintain the black and white color scheme
3. WHEN the accordion is expanded or collapsed THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback using the black and white theme

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer following project standards, I want all CSS and JavaScript to adhere to the established coding standards, so that the code is maintainable and consistent with project conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN CSS is written THEN the system SHALL alphabetize properties within each rule
2. WHEN CSS nesting is used THEN the system SHALL follow the established nesting patterns from coding standards
3. WHEN JavaScript is implemented THEN the system SHALL use ES6+ syntax with proper module structure
4. WHEN class names are defined THEN the system SHALL use kebab-case naming convention

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer working in a Vite environment, I want the utility to be compatible with Vite's build system, so that I can develop and build the project using the existing toolchain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the project is developed THEN the system SHALL work with Vite's development server
2. WHEN the project is built THEN the system SHALL be compatible with Vite's build process
3. WHEN assets are served THEN the system SHALL work correctly with Vite's asset handling

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer using the accordion, I want smooth expand/collapse animations, so that the user experience feels polished and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an accordion item is clicked THEN the system SHALL animate the expand/collapse transition
2. WHEN animations are implemented THEN the system SHALL use CSS transitions for performance
3. WHEN multiple items are toggled quickly THEN the system SHALL handle animations gracefully without conflicts

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer implementing accessibility features, I want the accordion to support keyboard navigation and screen readers, so that the utility is accessible to all users.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN keyboard navigation is used THEN the system SHALL support Tab, Enter, and Space key interactions
2. WHEN screen readers are used THEN the system SHALL provide appropriate ARIA attributes
3. WHEN focus states are applied THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indicators for keyboard users

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer integrating the utility, I want clear documentation and examples, so that I can quickly understand how to implement and customize the accordion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN documentation is provided THEN the system SHALL include HTML structure examples
2. WHEN examples are given THEN the system SHALL demonstrate both critical-only and full presentation implementations
3. WHEN customization options are documented THEN the system SHALL explain how to override presentation styles
